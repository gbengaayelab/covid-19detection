# covid-19detection
Decision Tree Classifier model that can predict whether a person has Covid-19 based on their symptoms. The model was built using the sklearn module in Python. The codebase contains two parts: the first part involves building the model, and the second part involves loading the built model and using it to predict Covid-19 based on input symptoms.
